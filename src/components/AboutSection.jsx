        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-black mb-6 fade-in">
          I am a passionate Frontend Developer dedicated to crafting responsive
          and interactive web applications.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-black mb-6 fade-in">
          My expertise lies in integrating data from RESTful APIs using modern
          technologies like JavaScript and React. I ensure that every
          application I build is universally accessible and SEO-optimized,
          leveraging tools like WAVE and W3C for accessibility and compliance.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-black fade-in">
          I have hands-on experience with Git and GitHub for effective version
          control, and I thrive on building user-friendly, visually appealing
          interfaces based on solid UI/UX principles. Whether working
          independently or as part of a collaborative team, I am committed to
          delivering high-quality projects that excel across various devices and
          platforms.
